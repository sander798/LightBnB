# LightBnB

A simple Airbnb clone created to learn SQL. It uses Javascript paired with SQL queries to display listings available for use along with some basic property features like the number of bedrooms and average rating. A user may log in or be created, see their own listings and reservations, and create new listings. A search function to filter through all properties is also provided.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: ```npm i```

2. Populate a database named ```lightbnb``` using the migration and then seed SQL files provided.

3. Run the server with ```npm run local```

4. View ```localhost:3000``` in your web browser.

```

* `db` contains all the database interaction code.
  * `json` is a directory that contains a bunch of dummy data in `.json` files.
  * `database.js` is responsible for all queries to the database. It doesn't currently connect to any database, all it does is return data from `.json` files.
* `public` contains all of the HTML, CSS, and client side JavaScript. 
  * `index.html` is the entry point to the application. It's the only html page because this is a single page application.
  * `javascript` contains all of the client side javascript files.
    * `index.js` starts up the application by rendering the listings.
    * `network.js` manages all ajax requests to the server.
    * `views_manager.js` manages which components appear on screen.
    * `components` contains all of the individual html components. They are all created using jQuery.
* `routes` contains the router files which are responsible for any HTTP requests to `/users/something` or `/api/something`. 
* `styles` contains all of the sass files. 
* `server.js` is the entry point to the application. This connects the routes to the database.
